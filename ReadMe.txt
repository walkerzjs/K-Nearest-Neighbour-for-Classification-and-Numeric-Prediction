The program was developed using python3.
Main packages used in the program: numpy, scipy, arff, matplotlib



All the algorithms are in the ‘modules/modules.py’
But can use ‘app.py’ to start the program and use them. There are some existed scripts in ‘app.py’ to use both classifiers and draw performance graphs.

To use ‘app.py’, enter the folder ‘files’, and use the command line: ‘python3 app.py’


The two dada sets are included in the ‘files’ folder (‘ionosphere.arff.txt’ and ‘autos.arff.txt’).
